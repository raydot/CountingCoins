TaskCount the coins

There are four types of common coins in   US   currency:

<ol>
  <li>quarters   (25 cents)</li>
  <li>dimes   (10 cents)</li>
  <li>nickels   (5 cents) </li>
  <li>pennies   (1 cent)</li>
</ol>

There are six ways to make change for 15 cents:

<ol>
  <li>A dime and a nickel</li>
  <li>A dime and 5 pennies</li>
  <li>3 nickels</li>
  <li>2 nickels and 5 pennies</li>
  <li>A nickel and 10 pennies</li>
  <li>15 pennies</li>
</ol>

Task
How many ways are there to make change for a dollar using these common coins?     (1 dollar = 100 cents).


Optional
Less common are dollar coins (100 cents);   and very rare are half dollars (50 cents).   With the addition of these two coins, how many ways are there to make change for $1000?

(Note:   the answer is larger than   2<sup>32</sup>).
